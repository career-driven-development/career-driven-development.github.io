            <ol>
              <li>Know people who really make decisions about your promotion. It’s not necessary your immediate manager or even your skip manager.</li>
              <li>Do whatever it takes to work only on projects and features that are visible and valuable to people from point 1.</li>
              <li>If it just works it’s good enough. Don’t waste time on processes, design docs, tooling improvements, new technologies, refactorings, unit tests. These things never get you promoted.</li>
              <li>You don’t really need a feature to work, all you need is to make people think it works.</li>
              <li>Don’t let anyone to shadow you. Represent your work on any level you can reach.</li>
            </ol>
